description: "How I designed my personal site (this one) by asking myself a simple design question: what are the use cases? By defining functionality first, form comes easily."

When I first started working on this site, I found the first steps of the process very difficult. How do you reduce yourself into a few words and a layout? How do you express who you are without being self-centered?

Luckily, there are a lot of established design processes for these types of problems. The first is **defining use cases**. Simply put, *how do I want my site to be used*?

I was mainly focused on a few cases:
1. visitors can find links to my projects/media
2. visitors can see my face (somewhere)
3. visitors can read about my ideas

With these priorities in mind, I started thinking about what I want my first impression to be, and ended up with this:

![current banner](/img/posts/original-site-banner.png)

This came from a variety of motivations. First, I wanted to have a *picture of my face*, in order to **keep things personal**:

![old picture of me](/img/eliasInTheSun.jpg)

This one is from a *long time ago* (don't judge), but I really like the colors in it.

To *explain a bit about who I am*, I added the **little blurb**, which conveniently **links** to a lot of *ME things* (like my github and instagram):

![site banner blurb](/img/posts/original-site-banner-blurb.png)

it also has a *link to my posts*, which are just posted below it on the home page. I chose to make it a blog because it would **allow the site to evolve as I learn/consume new things** (okay, also because I wanted to blog).

The background is a picture I took on a trip in Italy that I tinted down to make the blurb easier to read. There's a **trend** in visual design centered around using more *large images*, and its valuable to **share a visual language with your peers**, in order to **stay current**.

All together, it looks like this:

![site banner background](/img/posts/original-site-banner.png)

That covers the first two things: having links to my projects, and a picture of my face.

Great! Now for expressing my ideas in blog form. What are the use cases here?

1. visitors can find the posts on google
2. visitors can browse a list of posts

Because I plan to write about a variety of topics,

3. visitors can browse a list of posts with a certain topic

And because of my goal of expanding my online presence

4. visitors can subscribe to my blog

**I'll write more about SEO** and **building a blog with jekyll** in a later post, and for now, we'll *focus on design*. Let's start with the list of posts:

![post entry](/img/posts/post-link-image.png)

I decided to have the list of posts on the home page, so that visitors can get straight to the content.

Each post has an image (for visual engagement), and a title/description to show the content. I also added tags so that the user can navigate to similar posts.

![subscription box](/img/posts/subscription-box.png)

I also added a subscription widget at the bottom of every page, so that I can grow a base of readers. I'm using **mailchimp to manage the subscription**, which I'll cover in a later post.

And altogether, I have a personal site that includes a blog and covers the following use cases:

1. visitors can find links to my projects/media
2. visitors can see my face (somewhere)
3. visitors can read about my ideas
4. visitors can browse a list of posts
5. visitors can browse a list of posts with a certain topic
6. visitors can subscribe to my blog
