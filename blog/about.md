# Recently,
I've been working on getting **this blog** up, as well as on a currently **untitled project** with a close friend. During the week, I work with a great team at **Symantec**.

# I'm interested in the impact we can make as individuals.
While I know that enterprise-size software is built by teams, I want to see how much good I can do in the world with a laptop and a few hours every day. **You'll find some tutorial posts [here](/category/tutorials.html)**, that I will write as I teach myself about different technologies.

# I'm interested in art,
whether its film, writing, or anything else. I like trying to understand what other people try to express (and I might show some of my own projects here one day). **Some of my posts will be [reviews](/category/media.html)** of all of these things, and my thoughts that come from them.

***

I'd write a bit more, but that would give my stalkers nothing to do. And we wouldn't want that, would we?
